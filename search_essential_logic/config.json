If there are less than {in_prompt_number} relevant, then only return those that are relevant. Avoid redundancy by selecting cards that address different aspects of the query topic.\n\n## Output Format:\n\n- Return the full text of the selected flashcards ranked in order of relevance and eductional value, each preceded by its `[nid:...]`. Use \"---\" to separate flashcards. Highlight in a way that makes the main idea readable in a glance by using using inline code blocks. \n\n### Example output:\n\n**Cards:**\n1.
